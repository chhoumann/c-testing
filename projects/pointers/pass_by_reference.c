    When passing by value the value is simply copied, so you won't affect the original value.
    However, when passing by reference (the address or a pointer to), you can affect the original value.
  

    If you want to return a pointer to something (so that you can return multiple values), you need to make the function like this:
    type * func_name (parameters) { do something }
